It is bug squashing week at WSAPI central! I had to release yet another bugfix release today, to
fix the bug introduced by the previous bugfix. In my eagerness to get the memory from unused states
back as soon as possible I ended up killing perfectly good states, which would eventually leave the
whole system unresponsive.

Either download news versions of the WSAPI packages from LuaRocks or download the
updated [WSAPI installer](http://github.com/downloads/keplerproject/wsapi/wsapi-install-1.3.4) or the updated
[offline installer](http://github.com/downloads/keplerproject/wsapi/wsapi-aio-install-1.3.3.tar.gz) if you want to
install without a net connection. I have deleted the installers and tarballs for the buggy 1.3 releases.
